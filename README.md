# PS3 Dec GUI

A Insterface for PS3 ROM Redcrtpyion.


The decryption tool can be downloaded from [this site](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/)
or
compiled from https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec

This Program uses the one from the site, I haven't tested with the one from Git.


# Guide

It is Simple.

1. Select the folder where the Decryptor is located, not the file, just the folder.
2. Type in the Drecryption Key OR load a ".dkey or .txt" file containing the key, (the content of the file can not have spaces nor empty lines).
   Exemple:
     Good key: No spaces nor empty lines in the file.
        `A0B1A1B00A1BA0B1101AB0A11B0A10`
     Bad key: Spaces and (or) empty lines.
         `A0 B1 A1 B0 0A 1B A0 B1 10 1A B0 A1 1B 0A 10 1B
                                                         `
3. Select the .iso file you want to Decrypt
4. Select a Folder to save the Decrypted file.
   You can name it how ever you want.
5. Click Execute.
