A Insterface for PS3 ROM Redcrtpyion.


The decryption tool can be downloaded from [this site](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/)
or
compiled from [GitHub](https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec)

This Program uses the one from [this site](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/), I haven't tested with the one from Git.
