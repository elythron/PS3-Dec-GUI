# PS3 Dec GUI
Simple interface for PS3 ROM Decryption.


The decryption tool can be downloaded from [this site](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/)
or
compiled from [GitHub](https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec)

This Program uses the one from [this site](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/), I haven't tested with the one from Git.

1. Select the folder where the Decryptor is located, not the file, just the folder.

2. Either type in the Drecryption Key with no spaces OR load a `.dkey` or `.txt` file containing the key, (the content of the file can not have spaces or empty lines).
     - Example of a valid key: No spaces or empty lines.
       
        `A0B1A1B00A1BA0B1101AB0A11B0A10`
       
     - Example of an invalid key: with spaces and "or" empty lines.
       
        `A0 B1 A1 B0 0A 1B A0 B1 10 1A B0 A1 1B 0A 10`
       
3. Select the .iso file you want to Decrypt

4. Select a Folder to save the Decrypted file.
   - You can name it how ever you want.
